This is a space invaders clone written in Python 3. 

How to Play:
Move Left: A
Move Right: D
Fire: Space

The current iteration only has one level and the sound files are not working currently. I need to implement volume control. Current implementation needs to be downloaded and run through a Developer Environment using python3 space_invaders.py.
